# Journal for Homework 2

## What are we doing?

This week we are to build a webpage (or use the one from homework 1) that uses Javascript and jQuery. Since it has been awhile that I have used Javascript, I decided to take a [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/) at w3schools.com so I could remember exactly how it works. Once I started going through the tutorial, I remembered quite a bit of it. jQuery is a language I was unfamiliar with, so again I turned to an online [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp) to learn how it works. I found jQuery easy to understand and got me thinking about how and where to use it on my webpage. For this project, I will build a separate webpage and not use homework 1 webpage.

## Webpage

The webpage I am creating will contain text-boxes, radio buttons, and a card that will contain a photo area and button to move through pictures of your favorite season. There is also a temperature converter so the user can enter a number to convert and select the radio button to return the selected temperature reading type. The page will look something like: [alt-text](img/sketchofpage.jpg)
