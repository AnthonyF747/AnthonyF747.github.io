# Journal for Homework 5

Ok, after 4 weeks, I decided to start the journal and add to it as I go because trying to recreate stuff later has been like playing catch-up at the end of the week. 

Since my failure with getting the button, on week 4's ColorChooser view, to find the post method in the ColorController, I'm hoping that working with a model might solve some of the confusion. I'm almost positive that we need to put something in the .gitignore to make certain items in this project to be in the GitHub repository while other items are not included. This might be a question rather than research.

Well, here we go with the project. 

This project has us creating a maintenance form for an apartment/rental environment. When a tenant has a maintenance issue, the tenant fills out the online form and submits it for management or the maintenance person to handle the request. The application will have a database that stores the information entered on the form which includes the tenant's name, apartment number, and maintenance required.
